# One Shot

**One Shot** is a minimalist interactive narrative web game exploring the tension of decision-making under uncertainty. You play as an interrogator facing a suspect who may or may not have killed your wife. The game never reveals the truth — the point is your perception and the burden of your choice.

## Concept

- No definitive right or wrong answer.
- The player asks questions, receives randomized answers.
- You must decide to **shoot** or **walk away**, then live with that choice.
- A meditation on justice, doubt, and personal responsibility.
- Designed to provoke thought rather than solve a mystery.
